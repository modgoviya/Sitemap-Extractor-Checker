# Advanced Sitemap URL Extractor Tool

Welcome to the repository of the **Advanced Sitemap URL Extractor Tool**, a powerful application designed for webmasters and SEO specialists. This tool facilitates the extraction of URLs from XML sitemaps in any format, including nested sitemaps, sitemap index files, and non-standard formats. It's built with a focus on enhancing your website's SEO foundation by providing a deep understanding and effective management capabilities.

## Features

- **Sitemap Index Files Expertise:** Efficiently processes sitemap index files, ideal for managing large websites.
- **Universal Compatibility:** Capable of handling both standard and non-standard sitemap formats with unparalleled flexibility.

## How It Works

The app uses Python libraries such as Streamlit for the web interface, BeautifulSoup for parsing XML content, and Pandas for data management. Users can input the URL of their XML sitemap, and the app fetches and parses the sitemap to extract all contained URLs. These URLs are then displayed and can be downloaded as a CSV file for further analysis or use.
